# movies-java-application
->This is small Java project I made for OOPM subject. 
->Main aim is to show information about a movie that user wishes. 
->This will show some (around 40) movies in discover field.
->Also, user can search for a movie to get its info. 

Informations of a movie displayed to user :

1. Movie Title
2. Movie Poster
3. Backdrop poster
4. Average Voting%
5. Release date
6. Movie trailer
7. Movie crew and cast
8. Movie reviews

This project is using TMDb API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

I have used JSON library to extract data received from data base and DJNative Swing library to embed YouTube trailer.

P.S. The application will run on IntellIj IDEA and will require a TMDb API key.
After you get API key from TMDb site, goto src->Constants.java and set value of API_KEY to your API key.
